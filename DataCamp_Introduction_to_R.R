#Creating Vectors
  ##Vector for Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)

  ##Roulette winnings from Mon - Fri
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350)

  ##Create Days Vector to not have to type days out
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday","Thursday", "Friday")

# Assign the names of the day to roulette_vector and poker_vector
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector
